# Proposing features and enhancements

Sails contributors have learned over the years that keeping track of feature requests in the same bucket as potentially-critical issues leads to a dizzying number of open issues on GitHub and makes it harder for the community as a whole to respond to bug reports.  It also introduces a categorization burden: imagine a GitHub issue that is two parts feature request, three parts question, but also has a _teensie pinch_ of immediately-relevant-and-critical-issue-with-the-latest-stable-version-of-Sails-that-needs-immediate-attention.

The preferred process of proposal or feature submission is outlined under [Submitting a Proposal](https://sailsjs.com/documentation/contributing/proposing-features-enhancements/submitting-a-proposal). If you choose to bypass this process and use a Github issue to request the addition of a feature or extension, please make sure it's *purely* a proposal (not the issue medley described above) and labelled accordingly.

Please **do not propose _changes to the established conventions or default settings_ of Sails**. These types of discussions tend to start "religious wars" about topics like EJS vs. Jade, Grunt vs. Gulp, Express vs. Hapi, etc. Managing those arguments creates rifts and consumes an inordinate amount of contributors' time.  Instead, if you have concerns about the opinions, conventions, or default configuration in Sails, please [contact the core maintainers directly](mailto:inquiries@sailsjs.com).
